### ❄️ 5th of December 2022

I woke up and got to work early because I had to leave earlier than usual so I have a house viewing appointment. Besides that, I got a lot of stuff done at work. We got chicken barbeque wrap at work, which I found pretty salty. Furthermore, I got off work and went to my house viewing appointment, which was a huge disappointment. It wasn't as I expected it to be, lol. How ever, I'm excited for tomorrow because I'll go to the hair salon and make a massive change with my hair.
