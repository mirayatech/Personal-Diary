My day I started by waking up at 05:30 this time. The point of this day was to reschedule my schedule - to be more productive, change the learning path, and focus on what I have to improve in the software world. Moreover, that day, I went to the mall & fixed myself some new glasses, and bought myself some stuff. Well, once again, there isn't much to write about this day besides the highlight of the day that I've rescheduled my schedule and schedule cited to work on the new "road map."
