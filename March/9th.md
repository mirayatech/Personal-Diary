I had a great day. First of all, let's talk about the workday. I feel like I handled a lot on my own. I even took my learning strategies from the course "Master the code review" once I did code reviews on my colleague's pull requests. And I also  when it came down to my own pull requests. I just felt like I did everything correctly. I was really in a high-focus mode. Well enough, speaking of the day and let's talk about the highlight of the day:

I received my keyboard: `Keychron K2 Pro`. I also received Some paint sprays. I'm planning on painting this keyboard completely white since keychron doesn't sell any white keyboards. I'm in love with it. I now have linear switches (red), before that I had tactile switches (brown). Speaking of switches, linear fits me perfectly. I don't have to press so much when I'm tapping on the keyboard, which is nice since my hands are very lightweight. I'm really satisfied with my keyboard.
