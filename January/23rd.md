### ❄️ 23th of January 2023

A wonderful day. I started my day by posting a new reel on Instagram and a video on TikTok. Afterward, I continued with my deep learning, in this case, advanced javascript. Later I went to work by train. During the train ride, I read a book. The current book that im reading is `Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster.` So far, I like the book. Once I got to work, I went straight to the deep work, and luckily, I got many things done. I finally got information on the onboarding journey for February, ps I'm excited about it. Last but not least, once I got home, I organized myself and continued reading my book.
