### ❄️ 3rd of December 2023

It was a good day today. In the morning, I learned more about eslint, prettier and husky. After that, I went to work. I managed to fix my open pull requests. Moreover, I had problems with a few things, but I fixed them. I did more code reviews on my other colleague's pull requests. Furthermore, I had a meeting with everyone new to the job: what happened was that the CEO ay check24 talked about the company and a lot of other exciting things. We had a Bewerber with us today, which meant we ate out again.
