### ❄️ 2nd of December 2022

Today was a pretty chill day. It wasn't much happening at work 🌬️ I ate thai wook for lunch that my mom made for me. Unfortunately, I got an intense headache and decided to leave earlier 🤒 Moreover, I've started with a new book called "All in Programming" 📖 I'm so excited to start with it. As soon as I got home, I started working out and coding 🧘🏽‍♀️
