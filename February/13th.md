So there was a lot to do on only two of my open Pull request at work. One got already merged today, and the other one probably tomorrow. However, I'm pretty excited about my new ticket that im about to do. This one will be a significant improvement on our website, I think. Moreover, at work, the lunch was pretty decent. It didn't look that delicious, but it turned out that I ate the whole plate. As always, never judge the book by its cover, which im pretty good at when it comes to food. But only food. Once I got home, I continued on my new project im currently building. Im was not sure when it would be done. My deadline is at least a week.
