### ðŸŒ· 1st March

Well, the day is the one mars, and next month ill is moving to my new home with my family. However, I worked on a new feature today. It was a bit tricky, but all I needed was some thinking. Enough speaking of the day; I also received my new keyboard. It's much smaller, better and satisfying than I had before. If you want to know what keyboard I have and what I had last time, check out my Instagram posts; there, I post everything about my keyboard.
