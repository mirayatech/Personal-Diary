First First day of February is starting well. It is beginning with me starting with a new book. I even created a repository for every book I'm reading, where I take notes and rate my books. Sadly, the books I read in January are not there, but it's okay. Yall can check out my repository. I'm also currently editing my latest youtube video, which I'll try to post this week or maybe next week. 

Anyways, at work, everything went well. I finally got done with two of my bug tickets. Both of them were pretty tricky. However, I managed to fix them. So far, I'm still on my intensive learning and book reading. I enjoy it a lot. And for those wondering, I'm also building projects; many are just not public yet. 

I'm so excited top see what February brings me.
