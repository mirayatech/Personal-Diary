### ❄️ 27th of January 2023

I posted negative for covid, which meant I could return to the office. Honestly, home-office has its advantage and disadvantage. I think the best benefit of a home office is that when work is done, I don't have to take a one hour ride by train. I lose so much time just by taking the train. That time that flees/goes by, I could code or do something more useful. The disadvantage is if I'll have a question or need something, it takes time to wait for the person. While I'm in the office, I directly go to the person, face to face. Another disadvantage is that it isn't that much more fun in the home office than in the office. However, my day went well. My followers on Instagram are going up. I continued on with a feature that I've been working on since yesterday.
