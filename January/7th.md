### ❄️ 7th of December 2022


Today was an incredible day. I woke up at 4 am as usual and coded. Afterward, I had an appointment with the hairdresser. I did a Japanese straight hair perm. It took three hours, and the result was amazing. Later I came home and continued coding. It was a fun day but still, calm at the same time.
