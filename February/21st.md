Today was great because I finished my open pull request, which has been there since I went to Munich. Besides, for those who wondered, there was a day off of work for everyone in Germany on Monday. Moreover the pull request, I learned a lot. More specifically, it had a lot to do with server-side rendering and client side, how to change an element on the server side and the client side â€” I learned some new concepts/terms via typescript. Well, all in all, the feature I was working on was very instructive.
