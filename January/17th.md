### ❄️ 17th of December 2023

Today was a unique day. As usual, I got to work by train. I even came late to work due to a delay in the train. Once I got to work, I focused on all my open PRs, because Wednesday is our estimation day, which means theres new stuff to do. So far, I've managed all of my open PRs. Most of them are also approved. There are just three that need to be reviewed and two that I have to fix. After a while, I called the it-support system because my VPN hadn't worked in a long time. The person I talked on the phone with was a guy from Sweden. The best thing about that is everything went smoothly since it was easier for me to talk in my mother language instead of German. Furthermore, once I got off work, I bought myself a kebab, ate it, and last but not least, coded until bedtime.
