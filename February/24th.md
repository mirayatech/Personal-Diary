I had a great day today. It all started with me finishing up two bug tickets. Later on, we had a team lunc, where we ate in a Thai restaurant. Moreover, today's job work flow was excellent. The best part of the day was receiving feedback from my team leader. I know now what I have to be better / improve at and what I'm already great at. The best thing about it is that I can directly also change my planning / productivity schedule - by that, I mean learning structure, prioritizing what comes first, and much more. There isn't much to write about today, but other than that, and it was a fantastic day.
