### ðŸ‘» 26th of February 2023

I woke up at 5:00 and started my day by going immediately to my computer. I followed the new schedule I recreated yesterday. Moreover the schedule, I purchased a course from Curtis Einsmann, "Master the code review." The course is about creating better processes, giving better reviews, and writing better code. So far, I'm done with the first module of the system, and all I can say is I recommend this course to anyone who's working as a software engineer. I've been working on other things, such as improving my soft skill, typescript in an advanced mode, testing, and much more. I'm so excited to see how my February is going to end.
