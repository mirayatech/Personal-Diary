The first day of the check24 onboarding was pretty cool. My day started around 5:30. I fixed myself and ate breakfast at the hotel. Afterward, I met up with some of my colleagues from D√ºsseldorf, and we headed to the Check24 workplace in Munich. When I saw the building, I was impressed by how big it was - it's nothing like D√ºsseldorf. Don't get me wrong, D√ºsseldorf is nice, but Munich was Amazing. However, once we from D√ºsseldorf and everyone from the other cities meet up together, thats when everything started. It started with us getting breakfast from them and drinks. I didn't take anything since I already ate breakfast in the hotel and had my water bottle with me. Furthermore, we got to learn a lot more about Check24, how it was from 1999 until 2023, what the mindset of a software engineer in check24 is, what the CEO and CTO think, what kind of goals they have for the company, and much more. We also played a couple of games to get to know each other better. It was more like teamwork games and with strategies. It was fun, I guess. However, we all ended the day by eating in an Italian restaurant together. Since we're a lot of people trying to get a comfortable seat, I automatically got split up with my colleague, so I had to sit with others I was unfamiliar with. Well, it wasn't that bad since we mostly talked about programming and presenting ourselves. Well, with that being said, it was a pretty long and fun day.
