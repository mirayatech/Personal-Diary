Today is the day I go on my first work trip. It all started with me coming to work and working on my open Pull-Requests. Afterward, around 10:40, I and a few others moved from the position to the train station. At 11:10, the train came over the train, so I continued working on the train. Around 16:06, we finally arrived at the Destination: Munich. Afterward, we checked into the hotel, and lastly, I ordered food: BBQ Hamburger with fries. It was delicious!
