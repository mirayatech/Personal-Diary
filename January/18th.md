I started the day by building a "link in bio" project. I was done with the project in the same second. Furthermore, I went to work by train. I finished a lot of work I had since Monday. Before I went home, I played kicker with some of my team. Spoiler, I lost two times. Lastly, when I got home, I started a new book and coded until bedtime.
