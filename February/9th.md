The day begins with me sitting in traffic from 7:00 to 9:00. Ugh, what a waste of time. I took the car to work because people were striking (strike). The tam-train and the buses do not run. But the train does. However, at work, I concentrated on my open pull requests. I should have started with a new feature, but I want to finish my pull requests first, so there is not much to think about. I got most of it done. Right now, I need a code review from my teammates. More overwork, I brought food with me that I had prepared myself. One thing's for sure -  I can damn well cook. It was delicsous.
