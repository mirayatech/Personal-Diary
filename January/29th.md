### ❄️ 29th of January 2023


Today I saw the new home my family, and I will be moving into in April. I'm so excited. The house is perfect for us. Moreover, we ate in a Turkish restaurant. I ordered Adana with fires. It was super good. Later, we went to a "Dessert restaurant," where I bought baklava. At the end of the day, once i got home, i took a nap and coded until bed.
