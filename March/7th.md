### ðŸŒ· 7th March of 2023

I had a great day. It all started with me starting with a new book, "The Power of Self-Discipline." So far, I'm enjoying reading this book. Moreover, during the day, at work I got many things done. I mostly worked on bug tickets. The best part is that they all got approved on the same day - by all, I mean nine of my open PR. It was a smooth workflow today. Speaking of smooth workflow, my colleague is sick, which turned out to be me taking over one of his tickets. I'm glad I did it - it was the first time I experienced the type of responsibility of taking on someone else task. I also learned a lot about his Pull Request. Small things had to get fixed, though, but other than that, everything was great. The highlight of the day, all stuff I purchased at the weekend arrived today. Well, almost all, it's just my keyboard and MacBook that is missing, they will arrive next week. Besides the whole work day, I filmed an unboxing video for Instagram once I got home. I also continued watching one of my courses, and last but not least, I coded.
