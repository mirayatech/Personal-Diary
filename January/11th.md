### ❄️ 11th of January 2023


Yesterday was a long & fun day. I started by waking up at 4:00 am & coded until 8 am. Afterward, I went to work by train. Once I got to work, I did some coding and had a meeting and an estimation meeting. For lunch, I ate burger king and bought myself an ice cream. Later, we had an all-hands meeting with everyone involved in our product. Stuff was mentioned, such as our plans, how the future will look, and much more. After the all-hands meeting, I coded until 5 pm. Shoutout to one of my cocolleagueshat helped me with my huge struggle. I also learned a lot from seeing how he was debugging and thinking. Mad Respekt! At 5 pm, we had a "talk show," where my devlead did a presentation about "pact." Further, the day was over; I went home by train and went to bed immediately.
