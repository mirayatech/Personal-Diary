### ðŸ¤’ 13th of March

Today I was sick. Well, I realized later on that I was sick. It all started with me going to the office. Once I arrived, somehow I got throat sore. Later on, I started coughing. I then got sent home.

One thing is clear, once you are sick, it aint funny at all. The sickness takes your concentration away. It's hard concentrating when you code while being sick.

Anyways the highlight of the day is that  I just got my hands on the MacBook Air M1, and I couldnâ€™t be happier! As someone whoâ€™s been a fan of Apple products for a long time, I have to say that this MacBook is a game-changer.

Before this, I was using Linux Ubuntu, which was also a great experience. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by open-source software and the Linux community. Still  t thereâ€™s something about the sleek design and effortless functionality of the MacBook that I canâ€™t get enough of.

I love how intuitive the M1 chip is, and how it allows me to work faster and more efficiently than ever before. Whether Iâ€™m editing photos, streaming videos, or running multiple apps at once, this MacBook can handle it all with ease.

Overall, Iâ€™m so glad I made the switch to the MacBook M1, and I canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes me.
