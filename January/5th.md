### ❄️ 5th of December 2023

At 04:30, I woke up, got myself ready, coded until 6:50, and took the train to work at 7:13.AT work. I did some code reviews and continued with my new ticket from the estimation. Afterward, I met with one of the PMs, and she told me what they do and how they work. It was exciting. Further, more Went thru some of my open pull requests. It seems like tomorrow they can go on staging, I hope.

Fun fact, I got 100 likes on my latest Instagram post. I never had 100 likes before, haha. Lastly, after work, I ate my mom's cooked food and ended the day with more coding before bed.
