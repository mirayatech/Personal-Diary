Today was a crazy day. I posted yesterday on my Instagram story that I recently purchased a  new keyboard. Keychron K2 Pro, and im satisfied with it. The problem is that it is black. I'll be moving out soon and will have my room/office completely white. So I came up with the idea to spray paint my keyboard. I spent almost half a day on it, to be honest. But after all the hard work, it was worth it. Im so in love with the result of the keyboard. Suppose you'd like to see the results, checkout my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CppnJ49jYD2/) Feel free to enjoy, comment and share as well.
