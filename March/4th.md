It's been a long day for me, as I have been working on the course "Master the code review." I'm nearly done with it; I just have one module to finish, which I'm planning on doing tomorrow. Further, I continued my learning journey on typescript in advance with a deep learning approach. In typescript, I feel mostly in control. In the end, I worked out and watched a movie to end my day.
