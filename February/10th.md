Today was a productive day. Im did with my "deep learning" in javascript. I just got to learn more about OOP, and then im done. I'll move on to typescript as the following deep learning topic.   MOreover, that day, I ate my mother's homemade beef mushroom pasta today. It was delicious. Besides the food, my Instagram is going up. I almost got 200 followers.
