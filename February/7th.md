 I felt like it was a great day. I had an appointment with the doctor before going to work. Furthermore, I had a lot to do, but I didn't feel stressed or attempt many wrong things. I finished two PR from last week, started with a new ticket, and finished it the same day. I was waiting for a code review on my PR. Besides all the work, I had lunch with me‚Äîwhite rice with delicious chicken. Once I got home, I played with my little sister and went straight to my computer. There's nothing better than just coding peacefully.
