### ❄️ 25th of January 2023

The first time I had a home office. Well, it was more that I had contact with someone who has corona, so I had to work at home. The positive thing about working at home is that when the job is over, I don't have to take off and lose 1-1.5 hours of my time to get home, but I'm right at home and can start coding and learning with my stuff. The downside is if I need to talk to a colleague or ask a question, it can take a while until I get an answer. I usually prefer to go to my colleagues face-to-face. Anyway, it was a good day and my Instagram is also growing - Please follow me: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mirayatech/)
