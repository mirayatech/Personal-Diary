The second day of the check24 onboarding was strained but still fun. This time, my day started around 6:00. I fixed myself, packed my suitcase, ate breakfast at the hotel, and immediately checkout out of the hotel. Afterward, I went to the check24 building, where everything takes place. Fun fact is that I was the first one to be there. We learned more about the SSO, Carrier level, our native app, and much more. We played a couple of games with each other, such as strategies and teamwork. The whole IT-onboarding thing ended at 15:15, which means my colleague from  D√ºsseldorf  had a lot of time. We played Airhockey most of the mie before heading to the train station. Moreover, the ride home, from 16:49 util 22:28, took me to Dusseldorf. Even though I sat in the first class, it was crazy tiring. Well, once I got home, it was the best feeling ever. Besides that, the work-trip/Onboarding was fun but strained.
