### ❄️ 10th of January 2023

Today I decided to rebuild my portfolio with next.js. Before, it was with react, but now it will be with next.js for SEO purposes. Otherwise, the job was good, but it was stressful in the end because I had some problems I had to solve. The most annoying thing was that the train stopped today in the middle of the track and said it took longer to get home. Right now, I'm going to code and then sleep. I'm excited about tomorrow.
