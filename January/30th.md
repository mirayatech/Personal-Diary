### ❄️ 30th of January 2023

Another great day. Well, once I got to work, I continued with my thing. I got some PR I have to improve, but other than thAt, everything was excellent. Once the job was over, I went to a furniture store to pick and choose my furniture for our new home. The day's highlight was that my sister got a job at 16, haha. Legit everyone has a job as a software engineer in our family. We celebrated her getting a job by eating in a steak house.
